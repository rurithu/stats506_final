# Final Project 

### Question and Data 
Research Question:
Are women more likely to have iron deficiency's when compared to men, and does it occur in specific races differently?

Data:

* [NHANES Demographic data (2017-2018)](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&CycleBeginYear=2017)

* [NHANES Ferritin data (2017-2018)](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2017-2018/FERTIN_J.htm)

### Analysis Proposal 
I would like to use R and run a t-test on the difference between men and women to determine if there is a statistically significant iron deficiency, and based on if my results is statistically significant, I will run a regression model with the different races as predictors. If my results are not statistically significant between men and women, I will run a regression on my entire data set.
